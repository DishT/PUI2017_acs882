Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.
---> Hypothesis: The test sample (those dieting) will lose more fat than the control (those exercising).
---> Null Hypothesis: The test sample and the control sample lose an approximately equal amount of fat or the diet loses less fat than exercise. 


Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.
---> Hypothesis: The average IQ of children whose mothers are smokers is lower than the average IQ of children whose mothers are non-smokers
---> Null Hypothesis: The average IQ of children whose mothers are smokers is greater tha or equal to than the average IQ of children whose mothers are non-smokers



Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit,
vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. 
This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.
This is not a lab experiment, but you have data on the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

---> Hypothesis: Populations in what are defined as food deserts have, on average, higher rates of diabetes than those who have access to proper nutritional resources.
---> Hypothesis: Populations in what are defined as food deserts have, on average, similar or lower rates of diabetes than those who have access to proper nutritional resources.
