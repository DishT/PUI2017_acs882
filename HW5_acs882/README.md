I worked alone on part 1.

For part 2, I worked with Jon K. on finalizing a few of the graphs at the bottom, and we discussed what frequencies we used. 

For part 3, I worked alongside Andrew N. for collecting and merging the data, and while we ultimately went about it in different ways, we discussed our individual strategies. I also did a full walkthrough, after having completed most of it, with Jon K., in which we reviewed each other's work and discussed the implications of the statistical methods used.
