For Part 1, I worked alone for a first run-through, then spoke with Rachel L., Jon K., and Ruben H. about the extra credit in different capacities; though I ultimately got it successfully (I hope!) alone, much of the discussion centered around why the gaussian wasn't as 'pointy' as the underlying histogram.

For Part 1, it can also be noted that the Central Limit Therom appears to reveal itself through the increasingly-close-to-average means attained by running simulations on the distributions for larger sample sets, as opposed to the more erratic smaller sample sets.
