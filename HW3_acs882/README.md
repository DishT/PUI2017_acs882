For Part 1, I worked alone for a first run-through, then spoke with Rachel L., Jon K., and Ruben H. about the extra credit in different capacities; though I ultimately got it successfully (I hope!) alone, much of the discussion centered around why the gaussian wasn't as 'pointy' as the underlying histogram.

For Part 2, I didn't draw any conclusions (though my data did seem like it would reject the null hypothesis!), because it seemed that the requirements only went up to plotting of the data. I did this part alone - I couldn't find anyone to work with me! But will try to be more collaborative on future assignments.

For Part 3, I worked alone, as well. This should be fairly self-explainatory.
