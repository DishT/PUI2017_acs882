This homework is being submitted late, using my 72 hour extention. 

I worked alone on this homework, though did chat with Jon K and Andrew N regarding the setup or the Autherea account and layout. 

As far as taking feedback into account, I did quite a lot of this. I updated the way I measured the time of a trip from start-time to a more accurate mid-trip time based off of an insightful suggestion. I also used the recommended t-test. I wound up ignoring the suggestion for a Mann-Whitney U test, because my dataset for analysis had been condensed into two sets of 12 values ('light' and 'dark' hours), and the suggested size of each set in a Mann-Whitney U test is > 20. Because of this, I believed it could add more noise than insight into the analysis, and therefore left it out. 

I worked alone on the SQL exercise. I referenced Prof. Vo's notes in compiling my queries.
